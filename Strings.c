    /*
     Actually, the strcmp() function does not only check the first character of the stringsâ€”it compares the strings character by character until one of the following occurs:

     The strings are identical: In this case, strcmp() returns 0.
     A difference is found: The function stops comparing at the first differing character, and the difference between the ASCII values of those characters determines the return value.
    One string is shorter than the other: If one string is shorter and the strings are equal up to that point, strcmp() considers the shorter string to be "less than" the longer one.
